Lipe (a contraction of Logging and Pipe) is a Lightweight yet powerful Logging library for any use case. It allows the developer to specify exactly where the data should end up and in which form.

## Motivation
Lipe was created to be a Flexible and Extendable way of creating Logs and routing them to where they are needed. Much like winston, bunyan and pino its flexible and allows for a great deal of customization while following a functional and pure design philosophy.

## Documentation
